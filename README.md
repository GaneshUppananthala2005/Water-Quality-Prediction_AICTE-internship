# Water Quality Prediction - RMS
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`. It was developed as part of a one-month **AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell** in **June 2025**.

---

## Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
- Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
- Built a pipeline using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model and evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive experimentation

---

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4
- BOD5 (BSK5)
- Colloids
- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and 
- CL

## Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

- **R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

Performance was acceptable across all parameters

## Internship Details

- **Internship Type**: AICTE Virtual Internship - Edunet Foundation
- **Sponsor**: Shell  
- **Duration**: June 2025 (1 month)  
- **Focus Area**: Machine Learning in Environmental Monitoring

## 🔍 Key Features
Data Exploration & Visualization
Conducted thorough EDA to unveil patterns, handle missing values, and understand feature correlations. Used plots like histograms, correlation matrices, and distribution charts to gain insights into parameters such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, turbidity, conductivity, organic carbon, sulfate, trihalomethanes, and more.

Multiple Machine Learning Models
Built and evaluated a variety of classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K‑Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.
Identified SVM (or Random Forest, depending on your result) as the top-performer, balancing accuracy with precision.
